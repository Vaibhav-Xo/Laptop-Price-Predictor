# Laptop Price Predictor

# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that predicts laptop prices accurately. As the laptop market continues to expand with various brands and specifications, having a precise pricing model becomes crucial for both consumers and manufacturers. The project also has one user friendly interface that helps the user to enter their desired configurations and predict the price of their dream laptops.

# Overview of Project
This is a end-to-end Machine Learining Project that uses a Supervised Learning Regression Model which has been trained upon laptop dataset using a series of regreesion algorithims. The project EDA and Model Training part is conducted using Jupyter Notebook and the Application is generated upon Visual Studio Code. Libraries like Sklearn and Streamlit have been used in the process. The web-application is being hosted upon Streamlit Share  


# About Dataset
The underlying dataset consist around 1303 records and 13 features. Among the features are the likes of Company, Type, Inches, ScreenResolution, Cpu, Ram, Memory, Gpu, OpSys, Weight, Price and few unnecessary features. The dataset is very raw and requires alot of cleaning and preprocessing.

# Approach Used
### Data Understanding and Cleaning:
* Import the dataset and explore its shape, sample, and presence of NULL values, duplicate records, missing values, rubbish values.

### Feature Engineering:
* Extract relevant features from the dataset.
* Transform and create new features to enhance model performance.

### Data Visualzation:
* Visualizing the data and the patterns that it create by performing Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis using various various types of charts.

### Feature Selection:
* Selecting the appropriate features that effect the price of the laptop by checking their cooreleation with the dependent variable.

### Machine Learning Modeling:
* Traing differnt regression  algorithms like (linear regression, decision trees, gradient boost etc.).
* Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error ).
* Selecting the best model.

### Web App Development:
* Develop a web application using Streamlit where users can input laptop configurations and predict prices for their configuration.

### Deployment:
* Deploy the trained model and its integrated api on Streamlit Share.
